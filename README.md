Still learning here.  This ASP/NET MVC app was to test the ability to get meta data on books via their ISBN.

Using my handheld barcode scanner, I am entering barcodes of books I own to see if the API from classify.oclc.org can retrieve the metadata for it.

I am looking for a way to get the dewey decimal number for each of the books I own, so I can reorganize my books on my bookshelf via the dewey decimal system.

Keep an eye out on other projects that I creat and store in my GITHUB account that relate to this project.
